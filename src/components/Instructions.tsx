                    <span>
                        In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
                        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

                    <span>
                        Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.

                    <span>
                        Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
                        the eggs evenly coat the surface.

                    <span>
                        When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
                        middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.

                    <span>
                        As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
                        fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.

                    <span>
                        Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
